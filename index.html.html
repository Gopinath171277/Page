<h2>About PM2.5 and PM10</h2>
    <p>
        PM2.5 and PM10 are fine particles in the air that can be harmful to human health. PM2.5 particles are smaller than 2.5 micrometers, while PM10 particles are smaller than 10 micrometers. These particles can be inhaled into the lungs and may cause various health issues, especially for sensitive individuals.
    </p>

    <h2>Air Quality Index (AQI)</h2>
    <p>
        The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a numerical scale used to communicate the quality of the air and its potential health effects. It is calculated based on the concentration of various air pollutants, including PM2.5 and PM10. The AQI ranges from 0 to 500, with higher values indicating worse air quality and increased health risks.
    </p>

    <h2>Health Effects of PM2.5 and PM10</h2>
    <p>
        The health effects of PM2.5 and PM10 vary depending on the concentration and duration of exposure. Short-term exposure to high levels of PM2.5 and PM10 can lead to respiratory symptoms, aggravation of heart or lung diseases, and premature mortality in susceptible individuals.
    </p>

    <h2>Precautionary Actions</h2>
    <p>
        To protect your health during periods of elevated PM2.5 and PM10 levels, consider taking the following precautionary actions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid outdoor activities, especially during peak pollution hours.</li>
        <li>If you have respiratory or heart conditions, follow your doctor's advice.</li>
        <li>Use air purifiers indoors to reduce exposure.</li>
        <li>Keep windows and doors closed to prevent outdoor air from entering your home.</li>
        <li>Stay informed about air quality levels in your area and take appropriate actions accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
